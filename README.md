### Historical ciphers
`Ceaser cipher (ceaser_cipher.py)`: Cipher algorithm woked on the idea of algorithm to keep secret rather than key size. Ceaser cipher key size is 26. Once algorithm is known it is easy to break. This experience gives us important principle in cryptography called as `Kerckchoff's principle`. This principle states that attacker should not able to break the ciphers even attacker knows the algorithim. This is how new cryptography algorithm called as 'AES' is found during open competion. 

`Substituion cipher (substitution_cipher.py)`: Substitution cipher worked on idea that if key size is huge it can not be breaked. Substitution cipher key size is 26! (i.e., 26 factorial) which key size is approximately 88 bits (2^88). But that is not the case we can break substitution cipher with additional knowledge like letter frequency analayis. This is shown in file substitution_cipher_attack.py. Lesson learnt as part of substituion cipher if algorithm is weak even if we have huge key range it is easy to break.

### Modern ciphers
Modern Crpytography basic idea is based on `XOR` function. It has interesting property (message ^ random = cipher) and (cipher ^ random = message).

`One Time Pad (one_time_pad.py)`: It is unbreakable cipher because it is mathematically proven, but it is not practical to implement. So we use lower end of OTP for example 3DES. Stream ciphers are comprimised implementation of OTP. The One Time Pad is simply an XOR function. Here security lies in the random key stream. The beauty of OTP is the simplicity and proof that it is information theoretical secure given a TRUE random key stream. Requirments that OTP is unbreakable are i. key stream only used once. ii. key stream is generated by true randomness.
The security of OTP can be understood as follows:

- Given a cipher text
- Guess a plain text of the same length.
- Then there is a matching key stream that will decrypt the cipher text to that plain text.
- As any key stream is possible it could be plain text        

OTP is secured because if we guess a message we can generate that random key to get that message given cipher text, so all messages are equally likely. So if we decrpyt to any thing then it does not matter how much computing power you have because we can never know if it is right one or not.
