    Notes: 
        Double Data Encryption Standard (DES): This is 64 bit block and 56 bit key size.
        We use DES algorithm which is already implemented in py_DES.py rather
        than implementing by ourselves.
        DES has a 56-bit key (the key is actually 64 bits, but every 8th bit
        is a parity check; so, only 56 or the 64 bits are meaningful).
        
        Double DES: basically using DES algorithm twice. Here we reduce key space i.e.,
        0 to 255 but use DES algorithm twice. In DES key smallest bit is eliminated
        as mentioned as parity bit so though we have 255 keys we have 7 bit. 
        So for Double DES algorithm we have 14 bit key size. But security is not
        14 bits and this is what we show below.
        
        Here we brute force 7 bits each twice using two different for loops 
        rather than nested for loop. So we can think of security as 9 bits
        instead of 16 bits(here assuming 8 bits we are using). So in 
        summary double DES adds one bit of security. 
        
        Double DES is vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack as shown below.
        In this demo we reduced key space to 7 bit  for demo purpose so that
        we can store data in look up dictionary for brute force attack.
        
        3-DES:
            3DES was developed in 1999 by IBM â€“ by a team led by Walter Tuchman.
            3DES prevents a meet-in-the-middle attack. 3DES has a 168-bit key and enciphers blocks of 64
            bits. 3DES effectively has 112-bit security. 
            E( k3,, D( k2, E(k1, p ))).
            Why would we want to do decryption as the second step?
            One reason might be that by taking k2=k1; 2-key, 3DES becomes
            single DES with key . 3DES can communicate with single DES.
